This is a temperature reading application - reads temperature sensor information from ATTiny internal TEMP sensor or an additional digital 1-Wire temperature sensor and presents them to the user in varios forms.

It is a application which also automatically sends the data with temperature information to tmeperme.com cloud-based temperature monitoring platform.

So far this code is a proof-of-concept code.

This code contains two main pieces of software: 

tempermed - temperature reading daemon, reads information from USB temperature sensor and automatically sends the information to temperme.com web site where the measurements are presented

temperme_client - connects to the locally running tempermed and gets actual measurements and presents the data to the user
